# Mortal Kombat Strategy Guide Project
Who remembers the hype around Marvel's "Avengers: Infinity War" AND "End Game?" Fans anxiously awaited the debut of Thanos in a major Marvel storyline on the big screen. Later, we anticipated the Blue Ray release. Well, "back in my day" that is how video games were released. First, the game would be released in arcades. Then months later the game would be available for home systems. I can't recall any Arcade title met with greater anticipation than Mortal Kombat.

The first game rose in popularity due to controversy. Adults assumed that kids enjoyed the game simply because it was so graphic for the early 1990s time period. While that may have been a factor, fans of the franchise developed an appreciation for the in-depth story, the simple-but-challenging game play, and the over-the-top characters. When Mortal Kombat II was announced, people would line up to play the game and many more would huddle in crowds to simply watch people play. If we were lucky, we would see one of the finising moves or a character ending. 

I didn't get into it until after Mortal Kombat II had been released. I vividly remember gaming magazines hyping up Mortal Kombat 3. When I walked past an arcade called "Pocket Change" and saw a large crowd gathered around a machine, I knew it had finally arrived. I remember just standing back and watching others play. I would pay attention to every little detail hoping to find a secret or notice something that others hadn't noticed. We would all stand around and take guesses as to what finishing moves were in the game. It was a great experience.

Before the internet, kids would bring lists of finishing moves into school and the rest of us would ask if we could copy their list. Throughout the day, you'd see the list get passed around as the next kid would start copying the moves. After I started diving deeper into the gaming world, I finally saw the source of their infinite knowledge at "Electronics Boutique." (Later, EB Games whichi I believe was eventually bought out by GameStop.) A large book with the well-recognized Mortal Kombat dragon logo that said, "Strategy Guide." This book had every single move in the game, cheat codes, stories, strategies, and one even had a dictionary of arcade jargon. 

When I was a kid, I always used to imagine making my own. I didn't have the tools or the skills at the time. I'm going to have a blast with this project. I'll be able to refine my skills while fulfilling an idea I've had for almost 30 years but never intended to pursue. 

## Content 
This guide will focus on the cheat codes and character move sets relative to the first 3 Mortal Kombat games. 

## Development 
The entire project will be completed using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Image and sound sources will be credited in this document.

I will break down each process into "Issues" on GitHub. 

## Functionality
- Users will select one of the games from the menu
- The next menu will have game-specific information (such as storyline)
- Users will then select the home system for specific codes or rosters 
- Each character can be clicked, which will then display their biographies, move sets, and character endings
- Character Endngs will be hidden / revealed with view / hide functionality
